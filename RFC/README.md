## RFC Process

RFCs are comprehensive design documents that analyze multiple approaches and provide data-driven recommendations. Each RFC should:

1. **Document the Problem**: Clear problem statement with current pain points
2. **Evaluate Multiple Approaches**: Analyze 3-4 different solutions with pros/cons
3. **Make Data-Driven Recommendations**: Provide clear rationale for the chosen approach
4. **Include Implementation Strategy**: Phased plan with success criteria
5. **Provide Comparison Matrix**: Objective evaluation criteria

## Status Values

- **Draft**: Initial design, open for discussion
- **Review**: Under formal review by maintainers  
- **Approved**: Accepted for implementation
- **Rejected**: Decision made not to proceed
- **Implemented**: Changes have been completed
